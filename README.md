## End-to-End Analytics Delivery

> **Requirements ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí ETL ‚Üí Dashboards ‚Üí Business Value**

Healthcare organizations often struggle with fragmented claims data, delayed reports, and lack of unified visibility. This project solves that by delivering a single analytics ecosystem on **Azure Databricks**‚Äîtransforming raw HL7 claims into governed Delta Lake tables and live executive dashboards for data-driven decisions.

**The Project Flow:**

- **Define the Challenge:** Clarify critical healthcare questions‚Äîwhat's driving cost, risk, and readmissions?
- **Map Requirements:** Identify key KPIs (cost per patient, readmission rates, provider performance, high-risk cohorts) and reporting needs.
- **Ingest Data:** Land raw HL7 claims (JSON, CSV, Parquet) into Azure cloud storage and DBFS.
- **Transform with Medallion Architecture:**
  - **Bronze:** Raw claims ingested with full fidelity, schema validated.
  - **Silver:** Cleaned, standardized, and integrity-checked data.
  - **Gold:** Analytics-ready tables with KPIs‚Äîpatient cost, risk scores, readmissions, provider metrics, and condition trends.
- **Build Dashboards:** Create interactive Genie dashboards in Databricks for executives, finance, and clinical teams.
- **Validate & Iterate:** Ensure dashboards answer real organizational questions and continuously refine based on feedback.
- **Drive Impact:** Enable rapid intervention for high-risk patients, cost control, and better clinical outcomes.

## Featured Project Scenarios

### Scenario 1: HL7 Claims ETL & Population Health Insights (All in Databricks)

**Challenge:**  
Ingest and unify 1000+ HL7-format claims for actionable, audit-ready executive analysis ‚Äî no third-party tools.

**Solution:**  
- Automated ETL from raw JSON files to Unified Tables (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold) using PySpark and Delta in Databricks
- Genie dashboards for real-time KPIs, patient cost, risk, provider revenue, and readmission stratification

**Impact:**  
- Categorized $8M high-risk spend, enabled patient prioritization for population health teams
- Reduced analytic cycle time by 70%

**Stack:**  
Databricks, Azure Free Subscription, HL7 JSON, Delta Lake, PySpark

**Validated On:**  
Azure Free Subscription (azure_subscription 1), Databricks Community Edition

---

### Scenario 2: Real-Time HL7 Data Quality & Readmission Monitoring

**Challenge:**  
Build a live, ETL-integrated readmission/outcomes risk dashboard ‚Äî without leaving Databricks.

**Solution:**  
- Designed streaming-compatible Delta tables for ongoing data ingestion
- Created Genie ‚Äúrisk overlay‚Äù visualizations to surface acute readmissions and track trending cost conditions

**Impact:**  
- Continuous risk monitoring for all new HL7 batches
- Enabled ‚Äútriage view‚Äù for clinicians ‚Äî cut manual spreadsheet analysis to zero

**Stack:**  
Databricks (Genie Dashboards), Delta Lake, PySpark, HL7 JSON

**Validated On:**  
Azure Databricks (Free/Community), real HL7 test data
